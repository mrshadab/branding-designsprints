### Pre-Sprint

So, how do we go about this? You might be thinking, it’s quite simple like:
- Talk to the client, ask them what they want.
- Send 3 mockups and pray 1 gets approved.
- Profit!

But - that’s just not usually the case. You need to dig deeper and understand their objectives & goals, and make sure you’re doing a good job at explaining why you have the right solution (And not the WordArt they mocked up)* You need to present the concept, the rationale and the story behind it. Guessing is a recipe for disaster. What we’re doing is creating a design process to ensure everyone in the team, including the stakeholders are steering the brand in the right direction.

So let's go and craft a great branding workflow!


*PS. No offense to WordArt, I actually love WordArt.
